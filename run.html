									<h1>Marathon Performance Data Analysis<br />
									</h1>
									<br />
									<p>This project uses R to focus on exploring historical race data and building a predictive model for the 2024 Flying Monkey Marathon. 
                                        By analyzing trends and patterns in runner performance, this project aims to provide insights into individual performance factors and generate a reliable race time prediction.</p>

                                <h2> Executive Summary<br /></h2>
                                <p>Thegoal for	this	assignment	was	to	predict	the	inish	time	for	the	2024	Flying	Monkey	Marathon	based	on	previous	race	data.	Using	a	dataset	from	previous	marathons,	I	created	
                                a	regression	model	to	predict	race	time	based	on	runner	characteristics	such	as	pace	and	
                                placement.	The	model	showed	a	signi icant	relationship	between	these	variables	and	inish	
                                times,	which	was	validated	through	residuals	analysis	and	prediction	accuracy.	The	inal	
                                prediction	time	for	the	upcoming	race	was	approximately	5hrs	20mins	35secs	or	5:20:35.	
                                This	prediction	can	assist	in	better	understanding	runner	performance	trends	and	helping	
                                participants	set	realistic	race	goals.</p>
                                <hr />
                                <h2> Executive Summary<br /></h2>
                                <p>In	this	analysis,	I	began	exploring	the	two	datasets	(MONKEY	and	RUNLOG)	to	understand	
                                their	structure	and	to	ind	any	potential	issues	with	missing	or	inconsistent	data.	Missing	
                                values	were	identi ied,	and	these	issues	were	ixed	through	data	cleaning	procedures,	
                                including	replacing	missing	values	for	time-related	variables	and	converting	date	columns	
                                into	the	appropriate	date	format.	</p>
                                <p>I	then	began	visualizing	various	relationships	in	the	data.	For	the	RUNLOG	dataset,	
                                histograms	and	boxplots	were	used	to	assess	the	distribution	of	mileage,	total	time,	and	
                                weather	temperature,	as	well	as	how	these	factors	differ	by	pace	type.	Scatter	plots	were	
                                used	to	explore	relationships	between	mileage,	total	time,	and	weather	temperature,	while	
                                time	series	plots	helped	analyze	trends	in	mileage	and	race	time	over	different	race	dates.	
                                These	visualizations	helped	identify	key	patterns	and	outliers	in	the	data.</p>	
                                <p>For	the	MONKEY	dataset,	similar	visualizations	were	created,	where	I	focused	on	total	time	
                                across	race	dates	and	the	distribution	of	average	pace.	These	provided	insights	into	how	
                                performance	varied	over	time	and	among	different	racing	dates.	</p>
                                 <p>A	linear	regression	model	was	built	using	the	MONKEY	dataset	to	predict	total	time	
                                (Total_Time_S)	based	on	several	predictors,	including	pace,	race	placement,	and	age
                                placement	factors.	The	regression	analysis	provided	estimates	of	how	these	variables	
                                inluence	race	time.	The	model’s	residuals	were	examined	to	assess	its	it	and	ensure	the	
                                predictions	were	reliable.	</p>
                                <p>Finally,	the	model	was	used	to	predict	the	race	time	for	an	upcoming	event,	based	on	
                                average	values	for	pace,	race	placement,	and	age.	The	prediction	was	converted	into	hours,	
                                minutes,	and	seconds	to	provide	a	clear	estimate	of	the	expected	race	completion	time.	This	
                                model	serves	as	a	useful	tool	for	predicting	future	race	outcomes	based	on	past	data.	</p>
                                <p>In	comparing	the	predicted	marathon	time	of	5:20:35,	based	on	a	pace	of	12.19784	minutes	
                                per	mile	from	the	most	recent	Flying	Monkey	Marathon,	to	the	actual	time	of	5:38:42	from	
                                the	2024	Chickamauga	Marathon,	there	is	a	difference	of	18	minutes	and	7	seconds.	The	
                                predicted	time	was	calculated	from	the	runner’s	previous	pace,	placement,	and	age	
                                placement,	which	assumes	consistent	conditions	across	marathons.	However,	the	actual	
                                time	is	longer,	likely	inluenced	by	external	factors	such	as	race	conditions,	weather,	fatigue,	
                                or	course	dif iculty,	which	are	not	accounted	for	in	the	pace-based	estimation.	This	suggests	
                                variations	in	race-day	conditions	can	lead	to	differences	in	overall	performance.

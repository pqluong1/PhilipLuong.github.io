                                <p>I am analyzing the relationship between an individual’s quality of sleep and their sleep du
                                ration to better understand whether the amount of time a person sleeps, whether short or 
                                long, affects the quality of their sleep. This association is discovered to be statistically sig
                                nificant, so this implies that individuals who have longer sleep duration/those who sleep 
                                longer tend to have better overall quality of sleep.</p>
                                <p>I am also analyzing the relationship between an individual’s stress level and their sleep du
                                ration to better understand whether the amount of time a person sleeps, whether short or

                                cant, so this implies that individuals who have longer sleep duration/those who sleep

                                sleep duration because I want to better understand whether the amount of time a person

                                <p> I’m using a multiple regression model to predict an individual’s quality of sleep based on 
                                their sleep duration, their gender, and their occupation. I want to better understand how 
                                the amount of time a person sleeps, whether short or long, as well as knowing their gender 
                                and occupation, may affect their overall sleep quality.</p>
                                <p> I’m making this model because I want to better understand how the amount of time a 
                                person sleeps, whether short or long, as well as knowing their gender and occupation, may
